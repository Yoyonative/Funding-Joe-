Help Joe and Jules for the situation they have been put in! Joe has lost all his personal belongings and needs help for his
Jules(daughter) they both are in a situation that's toxic and could be harmful for development of our beloved Jules. I 
Guess this is a cry for help doing things as a single father. I've donated all myself and I have nothing left. I work for us and our funds but some people 
forget I cannot access them because it's a peer to peer contract with myself. So I'm asking for a lil help for a private and truthful mentor and financial assistance to guide us in the correct 
and positive action in a guidefull path to strive to make us better so we can all see a change in others and will make the flow much better and alot more easily for our physical health.
so I'm asking for asap help thank you all!
